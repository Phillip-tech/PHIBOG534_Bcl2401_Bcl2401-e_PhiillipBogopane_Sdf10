: Understanding APIs' basic concept, functionality, and purpose in software development.

Interface: The definition and role of interfaces in technology and how they differ from APIs.

: Learning the key components that make up an API.

: Differentiating between various types of APIs and their specific roles and applications in technology.

: Understanding how Remote APIs function, including their request-response mechanism


Term/Concept 1: API (Application Programming Interface) 

Definition: [I will write the definition in my own words]  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): [5]  

Example/Application: [I will provide an example or explain how this term/concept is applied]

 

Term/Concept 2: interface

Definition: [interface is point of communication between different components of an application or system. They allow hardware devices to connect and interact with each other.
]  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): [5]  

Example/Application: [USB (Universal Serial Bus) Interfaces: Used to connect devices like scanners, printers, digital cameras, external storage, and keyboards to computers.]

 

Term/Concept 3: API Components

Definition: [The API client initiates API requests. It can be a development tool or a service within an application.]  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): [1 = Not clear, 5 = Very clear]  

Example/Application: [When you search for a product on an e-commerce website, the client triggers an API request to retrieve relevant product data.]

 

Term/Concept 4:Types of APIs 

Definition: [A Remote API (Application Programming Interface) allows developers to interact with resources located outside their local environment. These APIs enable communication between different systems over a network, typically the internet,Unlike local APIs that operate within the same application or device, remote APIs facilitate interactions with external servers or services]  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): [3]  

Example/Application: [Twitter API: Twitter provides a web API that allows developers to access and manipulate Twitter data programmatically. With the Twitter API, you can retrieve tweets, post new tweets, search for users, and more.Developers use the Twitter API by making HTTP requests to specific endpoints, such as:
Fetching a userâ€™s timeline: GET https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json
Posting a tweet: POST https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json]

 

Term/Concept 5: Remote (Web) APIs

Definition: [A Remote API (Application Programming Interface) allows developers to interact with resources located outside their local environment. These APIs enable communication between different systems over a network, typically the internet.]  

My Understanding (Rate 1-5): 3

Example/Application: [twitter API]


1.What was the most interesting thing you learned in this module?

Chat-bots ,Chats-bots are becoming increasingly popular as a way for businesses to interact with customers. APIs make it easy to build chat-bots that can integrate with back-end systems and services, enabling businesses to offer personalised and interactive experiences for their customers.
What topic or concept did you find most challenging? Why?


2.When it comes to APIs, one of the most challenging aspects is understanding the intricacies of authentication and security.Why:Authentication ensures that only authorised users can access an API. However, choosing the right authentication method can be perplexing.
How can you apply what you've learned from this course to real-life situations or other subjects?


Leverage APIs to access and analyse vast amounts of data, enabling you to create intelligent applications. For example, you could build a traffic prediction app that uses real-time traffic data from various sources or a stock market analysis tool that factors in news sentiment and historical trends
Do you have any questions or areas where you need more clarification?



[List the areas or topics where you need to improve]

Understanding of the Components.


Command line and Connecting to APIs with Curl


My Action Plan:

[Detail the steps you plan to take to improve your understanding or skills in these areas]

1.Understand RESTful APIs:By familiarising myself with the key components of an API request: the endpoint, HTTP method, headers, and request body.

2.Master curl Basics:by learning command-line utility for transferring data to or from remote servers.

3.Learn the practicall side  of  powerful command-line utility for transferring data to or from remote servers.

4.Learn practically HTTP GET Requests: How to Use the GET method to retrieve specific resources from the server.

5.Learn practically HTTP POST Requests:How-POST creates a new resource on the server.
